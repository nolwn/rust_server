# Rust Server
## What is this?
This is a little server project that is written in Rust. It uses Rocket as a web framework and Diesel as an ORM.

## Installation
1. [Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Clone this repo
3. From the root folder, `cargo run`

# Independent Study Proposal

Answer questions for one of the following options

## Structured options

* Replace the backend with another language (eg. C#, python, Golang, Java, etc...).
* Replace the frontend with another framework (eg. Angular, Vue, etc...).
* Replace the postgres with a NoSQL database.
* Use Graphql to communicate between the frontend and backend.
* Test the backend.
* Test the frontend.
* Deploy the backend to AWS Lambdas.

**If you are doing using the provided project as a base, how are you going to modify it or extend it?**

I am going start writing a backend in Rust. For the first few days it will be fun and cool and everything will make sense, but, as I get more into writing the code, I will become frustrated and disillusioned with my choice. Afraid of not completing the server, I will work late a few nights, trying to hunt down better documentation and combing through the Stack Overflow questions over and over again until the words are just a meaningless blur. My head will fill with thoughts of having to stand up infant of the class, with no server, and admit that I failed. I am determined to prevent this outcome.

By midweek the second week I will be sitting at my desk and realize that I will not be able to finish. This will fill me with a sense of failure and despair. I will stare at my computer, fighting back the urge to scream, and fantasize about walking across the street and applying to a job at Salumi.

It wouldnâ€™t be so bad, maybe they would let me take home free salami some nights.

The next day I will come in more resigned and keep plugging away fruitlessly at my server. A breakthrough will eventually come but it will be late Thursday afternoon, and I will not have time to pull the rest of the thing together before my presentation.
